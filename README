WHATS IT DO?

Lime is a library plus tools for fast non-destructive interactive image editing.
A unique approach is used, using filters which work with scaled images for higher performance when screen size exceeds image size.
Image editing is based an a filter chain for non-destructive editing.
Lime is very fast and easy on memory:

Memory usage (observed by valgrind --tool=massif):

creating an image pyramid
limedo savetiff:filename=output.tif input.tif          29.55MB     default tile size 25MB!


execution time for

real    1m23.855s
user    0m27.258s
sys     0m5.070s


USAGE

Included applications are "limeview" and "limedo".
limeview is a gui application to view, edit, tag (using xmp sidecars) and sort images.
limedo will execute a filter graph on the commandline.

EXAMPLES

  limedo sharpen:strength=50.0,savejpeg:filename=output.jpg input.jpg
  
This will sharpen input.jpg with strenth=50.0 and then save it to output.jpg


  limedo pretend:scale=1,sharpen:strength=50.0,savejpeg:filename=output.jpg input.jpg

Same as before, but at half scale (we pretend scale to be one step higher than it actually is).


  limedo pretend:scale=3,rotate:rotation=90,savejpeg:filename=output.jpg input.jpg

Scale input.jpg down by a factor of 8, rotate by 90 degrees and save as output.jpg
