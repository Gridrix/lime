WHATS IT DO?

Lime is a library plus tools for fast non-destructive interactive image editing.
It's very fast.
It has very low memory consumption.

USAGE

Included applications are "limeview" and "limedo".
limeview is a gui application to view, edit tag and sort images.
limedo will execute a filter graph on the commandline, for example for image conversion

examples:

  limedo sharpen:strength=50.0,savejpeg:filename=sharpened.jpg P9253314.JPG
  
This will filter inputimage.tif with a gaussian blur with sigma=100 and
then save it to blurred.tif


  limedo pretend:scale=1,sharpen:strength=50.0,savejpeg:filename=output.jpg input.jpg

Same as before, but at half scale (we pretend scale to be one step higher than it actually is).


  limedo pretend:scale=3,rotate:rotation=90,savejpeg:filename=output.jpg input.jpg

Scale input.jpg down by a factor of 8, rotate by 90 degrees and save as output.jpg
